    "##### 48. Can you explain the concept and applications of reinforcement learning in neural networks?\n",
    "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning where an agent learns to make sequential decisions in an environment to maximise a reward signal. In neural networks, RL algorithms can be used to train models to perform tasks such as game playing, robotics control, and autonomous systems. The network learns through trial and error, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, and adjusting its actions accordingly to achieve optimal performance.\n"

    "##### 49. Discuss the impact of batch size in training neural networks.\n",
    "Batch size refers to the number of training examples processed in each iteration during neural network training. The choice of batch size has an impact on training dynamics and computational efficiency. A larger batch size can provide a more stable gradient estimate, leading to faster convergence but with increased memory requirements. Smaller batch sizes offer less stability but can facilitate exploration of different data points and generalise better. The selection of an appropriate batch size depends on the specific problem, available computational resources, and trade-offs between convergence speed and generalisation\n"

    "Current limitations of neural networks include the need for large labelled datasets, lack of interpretability, susceptibility to overfitting, computational complexity, and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Future research areas include explainability, transfer learning, robustness against attacks, model efficiency, and lifelong learning.\n"
